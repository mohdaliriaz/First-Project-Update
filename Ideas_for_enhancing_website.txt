Ideas for Improvement of my website:
1. Adding a proposition; The value proposition, or mission statement, tells the
 visitor what you do and why you do it.
  Puting a value proposition on the home page, will make it look more appealing.
 It will let the visitors know exactly what the website is all about.
2. Create an 'About Me' page or section;  The “About me” section/page is ideal 
for in-depth information about my passions and interests as well as for 
discussing my current level of expertise.
3. Creating more animated effects so that the user finds it easier to navigate
to pages with ease and get a better impression.
4. Make my contact infromation more prominent.Contact information is one of the
 most critical elements of your design. It’s vital to make sure that it’s easy
 for visitors to get in touch with you. I would also add a navigation
 option specifically for contact information.
5.Introducing a Thank You Page;It’s one of the most effective
 ways to keep people engaged. Thank you pages give you an opportunity to have 
the user sign to follow you on social media, etc
